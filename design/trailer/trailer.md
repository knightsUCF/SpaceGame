Observe the design of Everspace.jpg

Bright lights, to light upt he galaxy around,a nd also nice rim lighto nt he rocks in the distance to give them some form

Perhaps fog would work here well too, but we need to light the rim, or instead of fog, just dim the lights, and use a dedicated rim light

This kind of graphics will do wonders for the trailer
