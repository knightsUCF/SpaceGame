I really like the big blocky form, with the middle beams built sparsely, from sparse materials, makes sense in deep space


I also like the strangely shaped hull, with the platform things, outward indentiations to bring out the flow of the design

Go through Pinterest and other reference materials, and draw a combination of what looks good:

I really like ss3, how clean that looks for a toy, something that has no frills, but realistic enough for an experience

Study space ship / space stations scaffolding railing, choose something really cool.

Will look great in VR and deep space.
