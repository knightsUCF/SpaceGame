# Main Game Loop

* make sure we can experience the game in a continhuous comfortable game loop

* this includes:
  * game start transitions
  * game end transitions
  * game restart transitions
  * level transitions
  * sufficient explanation for the doable stuff
  * making sure the player is doing the right thing to progress along




# Start Ship Place

* start the ship in the middle forward

* perhaps have a 3 2 1 countdown, arcade style

* what are some other arcade starter games?

* allow the player to rotate the ship but not move



# Game Over

* on game over screen, give some sort of audiovisual feedback in the moment that we wait to restart game

* make the restart period long enough to prevent the player from losing

* on game over perhaps we can watch our action of our death in a randomized angle each time, for that loadout screen, before we are allowed to restart the game, upon which perhaps something comes up "R to Restart" so whe know we can restart then, especially at the end of some sort of musical queue



# Loot Boxes

* the asteroids are loot boxes

* like in mario, randomize the power up we get

* there will be also cross randomization strategies from the rogue genre

# Loot Model

* perhaps some sort of circlular half outline, with some goodie in the middle of the sphere

* two glowing arches, rotating, like in Mer de Noms, those spin towards you taking place of the asteroid


# Roguelike

* make the game roguelike in the sense of fun and progression, using procedural / random stuff

* rogue elements will make the game replayable, each time a unique experience

# Asteroid Speed

* increase the speed of the base asteroids on further levels, with random once in a while asteroids going super fast past you

# Log Screen

* create log screen on the left, which later can be used as an info display for the player

* in the position of where we would place a large TV to our side
