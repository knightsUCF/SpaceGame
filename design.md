# Order of Tasks

* keep outlining here important stuff

* determine tasks which can be done without VR

* get the intro and menus in early

<p>

1. Menu

2. Main Game Loop



# Game Progression

* different levels, different ship models

* increased formations and resilience of AI

* increased loot power ups, weapons, bonuses

* faster asteroids

* different colored asteroids, and also different shapes and arrangements

* different skyboxes (worlds), planet arrangements

* bosses?

* ...


# Menus (GUI)

* use the SF blue pack for windows and menu buttons

* create complete menu from these elements

* create score closer to home, in upper right hand corner, slightly rotate





# How to Find the Fun

Use the iteration model from Faster Than Light, where they hardly had a game design document, and found the fun through iteration


# Main Game Loop

* make sure we can experience the game in a continhuous comfortable game loop

* a continous game loop will create flow and a proper game experience for the players

* this includes:
  * game start transitions
  * game end transitions
  * game restart transitions
  * level transitions
  * sufficient explanation for the doable stuff
  * making sure the player is doing the right thing to progress along
  
* offer a pause button from early on

* can also do some voice guided computer tutorial stuff, but as long as we know what buttons are the rest should work first in a continous way before addressing button configurations

* later for button configurations we can let the player assign their own buttons

* perhaps for now we can have a diagram of an xbox controller, on which we can flash what to press, and then during gameplay also do that, so an average gamer will have every clue to figure out the gameplay without experiencing any sort of pain points




# Start Ship Place

* start the ship in the middle forward

* perhaps have a 3 2 1 countdown, arcade style

* what are some other arcade starter games?

* allow the player to rotate the ship but not move



# Game Over

* on game over screen, give some sort of audiovisual feedback in the moment that we wait to restart game

* make the restart period long enough to prevent the player from losing

* on game over perhaps we can watch our action of our death in a randomized angle each time, for that loadout screen, before we are allowed to restart the game, upon which perhaps something comes up "R to Restart" so whe know we can restart then, especially at the end of some sort of musical queue



# Loot Boxes

* the asteroids are loot boxes

* ships are also loot boxes

* like in mario, randomize the power up we get

* there will be also cross randomization strategies from the rogue genre


# Loot Model

* perhaps some sort of circlular half outline, with some goodie in the middle of the sphere

* two glowing arches, rotating, like in Mer de Noms, those spin towards you taking place of the asteroid


# Roguelike

* make the game roguelike in the sense of fun and progression, using procedural / random stuff

* rogue elements will make the game replayable, each time a unique experience

# Asteroid Speed

* increase the speed of the base asteroids on further levels, with random once in a while asteroids going super fast past you

# Log Screen

* create log screen on the left, which later can be used as an info display for the player

* in the position of where we would place a large TV to our side


# Art

* main models will be:
  * ships
  * planets
  * skyboxes
  * particle effects


# Story Intro

* have this early in the game, even if this is just a panel

* perhaps in VR we could be flying through the asteroids, next to a planet, while this intro plays out

* create a skip button for the intro to keep the game loop continous and always accessible


# Code

* use the existing code base but build on a clean and simple foundation
