# Start Ship Place

* start the ship in the middle forward

* perhaps have a 3 2 1 countdown, arcade style

* what are some other arcade starter games?

* allow the player to rotate the ship but not move



# Game Over

On game over screen, give some sort of audiovisual feedback in the moment that we wait to restart game.

Make the restart period long enough to prevent the player from losing.



# Loot Boxes

* the asteroids are loot boxes

* like in mario, randomize the power up we get

* there will be also cross randomization strategies from the rogue genre

# Loot Model

* perhaps some sort of circlular half outline, with some goodie in the middle of the sphere

* two glowing arches, rotating, like in Mer de Noms, those spin towards you taking place of the asteroid


# Roguelike

* make the game roguelike in the sense of fun and progression, using procedural / random stuff

* rogue elements will make the game replayable, each time a unique experience

# Asteroid Speed

* increase the speed of the base asteroids on further levels, with random once in a while asteroids going super fast past you

# Log Screen

* create log screen on the left, which later can be used as an info display for the player

* in the position of where we would place a large TV to our side
