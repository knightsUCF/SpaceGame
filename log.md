* we have nice power ups to try out for free: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/powerup-particles-16458

* these will be revealed when some asteroids and or ships are destroyed

* an easy power up to do is triple lasers, perhaps this power up is time based like in Mario, so we don't just give you something forever, which would lower the perceived value of the gift

* there are some nice particle effects that we can try out, go through these and jot down what is useable for each

* the ship model is really nice looking, and we can replace our current ship with that model

* from the same asset creator, there is a nice ship pack we can use to start out with for the enemies

* we will definitely need different skyboxes for each level

* we need lots of progression, and a sense of wonder to make the game fun

* create the intro story mode with a skip button for fast gameplay

* we need a nice overlay GUI, which tells us our score, and how much ammo we have

* here is a nice power ups set: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/power-up-fx-152740 and https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/sci-fi-powerup-item-crate-18990 and https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/spells/loot-drop-fx-147479

* we just need to keep iterating on the powerups to make them look badass

* although we are not directly going for retro, we could have all sorts of updated sounds, when things rev up, exponential stuff like the logic trick, where you can add the exponential decay to create some cool sounds, the effects are important, spend a lot of time on the sound effects, even if we have to create them ourselves

* these are some very cool radar shaders we can use: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/silhouette-radar-shaders-97229

* definitely use the radar shaders, adds a lot of oomph to the game, use for: when an enemy takes damage they flash like this, perhaps when our shields, or the inner core of the ship takes damage we flash this, we can use different color for variety and situations, even some heavier asteroids might flash this color if we are trying to penetrate to the goodies, this effect definitely looks amazing in VR so use this

* we need lots of audiovisual candy like the above shader, this is paramount for a game like this, use all the sugar tricks they say to use, so make the lasers bigger, more powerful, delay the enemy slightly if they take damage, fine tune and polish in order of priorites

* we could even move the player to a different angle or spot of the galaxy that we are fighting for some more adrenalin rushing moments, although we need to keep constant velocity without acceleration (or teleportation), and ask the player before we do this, not sure if we will even use this

* so go through this list and organize tasks in order of importance

* universal sound effects library: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/universal-sound-fx-17256

* have the game oozing with sound, keep feeding the player with new stimulus so they don't get bored

Interesting things:

1. physics propulsion system: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/b-propulsion-system-96220
2. physics lab: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/forces-physics-lab-135734
3. simple physics toolkit: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/simple-physics-toolkit-magnet-water-wind-vr-ready-53912
4. flight simulator: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/silantro-flight-simulator-toolkit-128025


# 10 / 5 / 2019

* begin on order of tasks in the design document

* get to MVP ASAP

# 10 / 4 / 2019

* creating the design document

* trying to keep the design document more lean this time, since this is a different type of game, and this method of working is easier
