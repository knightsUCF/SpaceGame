Very nice style spaceships, but a little too much poly: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/cube-spaceships-pack-01-110342


For purchasing items, we could have some sort of inter galactic black market, something out of Neuromancer, with the glowing green 3D objects, some sort of data links, perhaps we purchase plans to print in a 3D printer, etc.

One way of getting free advertising is to send out the game keys to magazines which review games.

Nice pick up items: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/modular-pick-up-items-99720

Check out "Enter the Gungeon", a relatively simple game but a success. Every scene is framed by a neon glowing weapon, we need to do the same: https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/

Study Enter the Gungeon and recreate the same sort of fun gameplay feel, along with Forager.

Also create a very nice research tree in 3D, which the player can orbit around, some sort of Matrix like cyberpunk feel. This will do wonders, namely three things: 1. break up the monotony of the game (perhaps we can choose this between levels) 2. create a research tree upgrade mechanism, adding to the progression and fun of the game, and 3. create strategy

Next to the research tree we could have the cargo bay, in which we can rotate the ship, perhaps add new weapons, check out how they look, and then pull up our tree of upgrades. Then after the player finalizes their selection, they are taken into the next level.

If we could do a really hip research tree like this but in 3D: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/sci-fi-upgrades-window-138966

And on top of this, the 3D VR Research Tree would be easy to do, and would really set the game apart.

Put a lot time in making the weapons feel good, like the creators from Dead Cells.

Also have some sort of orbiting glowing balls going around in nice circular patterns for the player to dodge.

Use Lerp and sine wave functions, and smooth damp and others to get a very smooth effect going in lots of things, so the game just feels great.

Also need a professional art cover, like Enter the Gungeon. We could have pilots, and perhaps aliens and ships, something very worth of Space Commander, like a cross between enter the Gungeon, and the Super Mario Land / Warrio box cover.

Make the best possible game in 3 months, ready for Early Access. This will pay off.

Also use a nice lighting effect, with beautify, or the light set up from Space Journey, to really make the glowing lights pops in the darkness, and against the space backgrounds.

Showing just darkness of course will not sell the game, but if we have all sorts of hologrpahic light effects, along with asteroids, and space ships, and lots of fast movement, that will sell the game.

We could do some triangular arrow like weapon, that has a nice coverage area. Very useful for getting ride of a lot of things in one area, so this would be used in harder levels, and have limited ammo.

We want to create a way for the player to use strategy in what weapons they use, so that they don't waste the weapons, and also for the player to triage and manage strategy with the rogue procedurally generating engine. So they will need to get a feel for the drop and spawn rate of objects.

There is anice sound effect for the menu we could use in the below sound effect pack.

* lots of high quality weapon effects, we definitely want to use this: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/sci-fi-vfx-91983

* search asset store for "laser sound effects", "laser sounds"

* here is a volumetric laser we could do something with: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/volumetric-laser-beam-40969

* also search for "laser weapon(s)", "laser beams": https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/laser-beams-weapon-systems-pack-18138

* this has an AMAZING laser beam weapon we can use, and the cool idea of using rotating mines: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/space-weapons-vfx-152817

* mines could also be deployed by enemies


* amazing free pack of SF sound effects: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/weapons/sci-fi-weapon-sfx-by-great-heights-audio-147911


* some very high quality shader particle effects / weapons: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/sci-fi-vfx-91983

* these SF sound effects for weapons are not bad: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/weapons/sci-fi-weapon-sound-effects-pack-1-106514

* search more for "sci fi" sounds, and also "sci fi weapons" sounds

* a very nice asset pack with a space base we can use in the terraforming game, even though we might use Unreal and port the art over: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/sci-fi-styled-modular-pack-82913

* even simple building and cultivation of life in deep space, (mining planet for resources with large overhead machines, etc), could be very nice to start off the VR terraforming game

* just experiencing stuff like this in VR would be awe inspiring: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/sci-fi-heavy-station-kit-hangars-augmented-147104

* this asset is very nice at procedurally generating tons of space environments: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/level-design/space-for-unity-space-scene-construction-kit-7095

* a few things to take away from the above asset, we can use space rings like saturn in the near distance to show off the VR effect in one of the levels, also space fog

* SF sound effects, should be easy to find tons of stuff: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/sci-fi-sound-effects-pack-4-106530

* hologram particles: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/hologram-particles-45196

* search the asset store for "hologram"

* hologram pyramid: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/hologram-pyramid-61735

* another nice hologram

* this hologram is very nice, we could use this for mapping the entire territory or something: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/hologram-shader-25876

* we could also use that for hologram for the ship in scan mode or something

* another nice hologram: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/sci-fi-hologram-shader-77666

* we have nice power ups to try out for free: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/powerup-particles-16458

* these will be revealed when some asteroids and or ships are destroyed

* an easy power up to do is triple lasers, perhaps this power up is time based like in Mario, so we don't just give you something forever, which would lower the perceived value of the gift

* there are some nice particle effects that we can try out, go through these and jot down what is useable for each

* the ship model is really nice looking, and we can replace our current ship with that model

* from the same asset creator, there is a nice ship pack we can use to start out with for the enemies

* we will definitely need different skyboxes for each level

* we need lots of progression, and a sense of wonder to make the game fun

* create the intro story mode with a skip button for fast gameplay

* we need a nice overlay GUI, which tells us our score, and how much ammo we have

* here is a nice power ups set: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/power-up-fx-152740 and https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/sci-fi-powerup-item-crate-18990 and https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/spells/loot-drop-fx-147479

* we just need to keep iterating on the powerups to make them look badass

* although we are not directly going for retro, we could have all sorts of updated sounds, when things rev up, exponential stuff like the logic trick, where you can add the exponential decay to create some cool sounds, the effects are important, spend a lot of time on the sound effects, even if we have to create them ourselves

* these are some very cool radar shaders we can use: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/silhouette-radar-shaders-97229

* definitely use the radar shaders, adds a lot of oomph to the game, use for: when an enemy takes damage they flash like this, perhaps when our shields, or the inner core of the ship takes damage we flash this, we can use different color for variety and situations, even some heavier asteroids might flash this color if we are trying to penetrate to the goodies, this effect definitely looks amazing in VR so use this

* we need lots of audiovisual candy like the above shader, this is paramount for a game like this, use all the sugar tricks they say to use, so make the lasers bigger, more powerful, delay the enemy slightly if they take damage, fine tune and polish in order of priorites

* we could even move the player to a different angle or spot of the galaxy that we are fighting for some more adrenalin rushing moments, although we need to keep constant velocity without acceleration (or teleportation), and ask the player before we do this, not sure if we will even use this

* so go through this list and organize tasks in order of importance

* universal sound effects library: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/universal-sound-fx-17256

* have the game oozing with sound, keep feeding the player with new stimulus so they don't get bored

* here is a very nice shield effect, which even shows taking damage: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/energy-shield-effect-with-transition-and-hit-response-100109

* here are lots of visual effects: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/ultimate-vfx-26701

* go for things that make the most impact, these will be: 
  * intro
  * SF menu
  * powerups
  * shields
  * progression / variety (weapons, skyboxes, enemies, asteroids, worlds, powerups, anything, list out how we can use progression for all of the noteworthy stuff)
  
  * nice forcefield: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/spells/forcefield-effects-123431
  
  * some cool things we could do with the hexagons: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/spells/living-particles-105817
  
  * this would feel like "Geometry Walls" where with progression difficulty we want to overwhelm the players sense, but we also want to have holographic light effects right from the start to ground them
  
  * light effects are especially good for trailers
  
  * nice warehouse environment for future games: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/warehouse-environment-110654

 So we will want to have enemy formations, like in classic space shooter games, this will be cool because we can line up formations, we might need to rewrite or amend the code from the ground up so the forces don't collider with asteroids, or maybe they also take damage from asteroids, or their shields take damage, that would be an easy solution instead of having to write AI to dodge asteroids.
 
 We will want to create variety, and overwhelm the player with progression right away, so they do not get bored easily!!!

Again the goal is to make a game that is like the Big Mac meal of games. So something quick, very easily accessible by people of all ages and creeds, something that shows off VR immediately. We would also like a short type of arcade gameplay, which people can use to introduce their friends to VR, because they don't want to just sit by ackwardly while their friends are in VR. So if they get a quick mega rush taste of VR, that will be enough to get them excited, and this will be a good proper party game people can use for a quick VR session. VR also wears on the user, so quick sessions are not a bad thing.

The other big thing is that we want to use Rogue elements for fun and replayability:
 * randomly spawned terrain (asteroids and etc) and enemiews
 * random items, sometimes you might get the item that saves you and sometimes you might not
 * permadeath, have to start over, helps with increasing playability of a small game, so players don't just easily beat and experience everything on the first try
 
 We could also use the roguelike genre description as a selling point of a game.
 
 "Space Game" is an homage to the space shooter genre along with roguelike elements. This game is perfect as a "party" game where you would like to show off your VR system to a friend.
 

This almost a futuristic game reimagined from the 80s on modern technology.
 
 
 * define the game's architecture as an early TODO

* very nice cube city we could use to make a Fez type game in VR. Very simple building:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/kubikos-3d-cube-city-147691


# 10 / 5 / 2019

* begin on order of tasks in the design document

* get to MVP ASAP

# 10 / 4 / 2019

* creating the design document

* trying to keep the design document more lean this time, since this is a different type of game, and this method of working is easier
