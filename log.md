* we have nice power ups to try out for free: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/powerup-particles-16458

* these will be revealed when some asteroids and or ships are destroyed

* an easy power up to do is triple lasers, perhaps this power up is time based like in Mario, so we don't just give you something forever, which would lower the perceived value of the gift

* there are some nice particle effects that we can try out, go through these and jot down what is useable for each

* the ship model is really nice looking, and we can replace our current ship with that model

* from the same asset creator, there is a nice ship pack we can use to start out with for the enemies

* we will definitely need different skyboxes for each level

* we need lots of progression, and a sense of wonder to make the game fun

* create the intro story mode with a skip button for fast gameplay

* we need a nice overlay GUI, which tells us our score, and how much ammo we have

* here is a nice power ups set: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/power-up-fx-152740 and https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/sci-fi-powerup-item-crate-18990 and https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/spells/loot-drop-fx-147479

* we just need to keep iterating on the powerups to make them look badass

* although we are not directly going for retro, we could have all sorts of updated sounds, when things rev up, exponential stuff like the logic trick, where you can add the exponential decay to create some cool sounds, the effects are important, spend a lot of time on the sound effects, even if we have to create them ourselves

* these are some very cool radar shaders we can use: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/silhouette-radar-shaders-97229

* definitely use the radar shaders, adds a lot of oomph to the game, use for: when an enemy takes damage they flash like this, perhaps when our shields, or the inner core of the ship takes damage we flash this, we can use different color for variety and situations, even some heavier asteroids might flash this color if we are trying to penetrate to the goodies, this effect definitely looks amazing in VR so use this

* we need lots of audiovisual candy like the above shader, this is paramount for a game like this, use all the sugar tricks they say to use, so make the lasers bigger, more powerful, delay the enemy slightly if they take damage, fine tune and polish in order of priorites

* we could even move the player to a different angle or spot of the galaxy that we are fighting for some more adrenalin rushing moments, although we need to keep constant velocity without acceleration (or teleportation), and ask the player before we do this, not sure if we will even use this

* so go through this list and organize tasks in order of importance

* universal sound effects library: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/universal-sound-fx-17256

* have the game oozing with sound, keep feeding the player with new stimulus so they don't get bored

* here is a very nice shield effect, which even shows taking damage: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/energy-shield-effect-with-transition-and-hit-response-100109

* here are lots of visual effects: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/ultimate-vfx-26701

* go for things that make the most impact, these will be: 
  * intro
  * SF menu
  * powerups
  * shields
  * progression / variety (weapons, skyboxes, enemies, asteroids, worlds, powerups, anything, list out how we can use progression for all of the noteworthy stuff)
  
  * nice forcefield: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/spells/forcefield-effects-123431
  
  * some cool things we could do with the hexagons: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/spells/living-particles-105817
  
  * this would feel like "Geometry Walls" where with progression difficulty we want to overwhelm the players sense, but we also want to have holographic light effects right from the start to ground them
  
  * light effects are especially good for trailers

 So we will want to have enemy formations, like in classic space shooter games, this will be cool because we can line up formations, we might need to rewrite or amend the code from the ground up so the forces don't collider with asteroids, or maybe they also take damage from asteroids, or their shields take damage, that would be an easy solution instead of having to write AI to dodge asteroids.
 
 We will want to create variety, and overwhelm the player with progression right away, so they do not get bored easily!!!

Again the goal is to make a game that is like the Big Mac meal of games. So something quick, very easily accessible by people of all ages and creeds, something that shows off VR immediately. We would also like a short type of arcade gameplay, which people can use to introduce their friends to VR, because they don't want to just sit by ackwardly while their friends are in VR. So if they get a quick mega rush taste of VR, that will be enough to get them excited, and this will be a good proper party game people can use for a quick VR session. VR also wears on the user, so quick sessions are not a bad thing.

The other big thing is that we want to use Rogue elements for fun and replayability:
 * randomly spawned terrain (asteroids and etc) and enemiews
 * random items, sometimes you might get the item that saves you and sometimes you might not
 * permadeath, have to start over, helps with increasing playability of a small game, so players don't just easily beat and experience everything on the first try
 
 We could also use the roguelike genre description as a selling point of a game.
 
 "Space Game" is an homage to the space shooter genre along with roguelike elements. This game is perfect as a "party" game where you would like to show off your VR system to a friend.

# 10 / 5 / 2019

* begin on order of tasks in the design document

* get to MVP ASAP

# 10 / 4 / 2019

* creating the design document

* trying to keep the design document more lean this time, since this is a different type of game, and this method of working is easier
