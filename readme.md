# SpaceGame


An homage to Space Invaders and the whole genre of asteroid space shooter games, along with tactile combat (meaning different weapons for different situations) and the base building of XCOM.

Space Invaders was the first sensational video game. We are inspired to create the first type of this kind of game for VR.

We want to preserve the fun arcade elements, like transitions on losing, restarting to the beginning (even though we will have rogue like elements), constant action, the timeless elements
