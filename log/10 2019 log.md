# 10 / 9 / 2019 - Leaving / Entering the Ship

Okay so a few things. We have the basics working, except the cameras. The issues is how we are going to grab the camera components if they are in the resources folder, I guess we can grab those components with GetComponent<>.

Also we want some sort of hiss unlocking sound when leaving the ship for a notification.


# 10 / 9 / 2019 - Exiting / Entering the Ship

So this is the big one right now really.

Here are the things we should do:

1. Fade to black when we switch from the astronaut to the ship, perhaps the camera will then move in on the player, and the ship will be much larger
2. Prevent exiting the ship when the ship is moving fast, so we need a velocity of zero to have the astronaut exit
3. We want to apply some basic jet pack force to the astronaut, perhaps we can do this with a neon green light, and an apply force thing
4. We want the astronaut to be able to walk around on the field. Perhaps let's do the basic navmesh thing here first, especially since we already have the steps written down, and then perhaps we can decrease the gravity for that effect, but at least we'll have the turning right.
5. We want to apply some basic movement force to the astronaut while in space, and turn off the ship controls, currently seems like we are still controlling the ship when switching to the astronaut control
6. Add a jet force to the ship, always glowing orange perhaps, and then glows green when moving
7. Add tilt on the up and down to the ship
8. Add camera rubber banding for more realistic motion. (We have this already set up on the space game, or check the flight tutorial, to extract just the code that does that rubber band thing. Will feel much more satisfying.)
9. Add some pleasant hum when the ship moves around
10. Add a hiss release sound when the astronaut exits the ships
11. Add some kind of lock strap on final effect when the astronaut enter the ship


No prototypes! Make sure you are polishing the core of the actual game, so that we are always in release mode, heightening our chances of success.

# 10 / 9 / 2019 - Great Progress

So when we say we made great progress yesterday we are not exagerating. 

We completed three game screens:

1) Menu
2) Generate universe
3) Gameplay

And we also set up a ship and an astronaut.

And of course we reworked the whole theme of what our game will be about. Seems much better now.

Now, the next thing to do is to focus on the rolling MVP. No prototypes!

So we would like to polish as we go, and focus on getting the basic gameplay right.

So not sure where exactly we should work from here, probably on just having the astronaut exit properly, and then be able to for example exit out on a platform, and also take off from the platform on the spaceship.

So build a platform as a testing ground.

Later we will use a 3D object mesh, by simply dragging in the complex poly planet, which will give us an exact surface area for the collider.

So pretty much we want to polish the part where we can exit and enter the spaceship, and also perhaps set up the navmesh and the smooth controller, although the question is how to adjust that for the zero gravity in space, and whether we will need to build our own.

We also want some sparkling stars in the intro screen, so we have some movement in the Menu screen.

Here is how to add relative torque to the player: https://answers.unity.com/questions/175325/realisticno-gravity-spaceship-movement.html

# 10 / 9 / 2019 - To Recap...

Okay, to recap we are doing well with getting the project up and running.

So recreating the game with our code base should probably take no more than 1 or 2 days.

So we will be in a good spot. 

But to recap, we want to always have the game in a runnable state, with working as close to MVP functionality as possibly, so when the deadline rolls around we will have something to show case.

So a few things about having a rolling MVP (no prototypes):

1. We can assume the core shoot 'em up gameplay will be fun.
      A) Create the shoot 'em up engine in such a way that we don't risk breaking things or reworking things
      B) Keep working close to the rolling MVP, so this means creating a foundation to accomodate different ships, different weapons, power ups, interchangeable things that we can count on working, and yet the interchangeability will also add a lot of variety and hence depth to the gameplay
      C) Adding lights, selections, sounds, those are all immediate big win elements, which we can count on working for the rest of the game, and not breaking last minute before the deadline.
      
2. Base Building

      A) Base building concepts will depend on the asset pack, what works, what looks good, what fits, etc, so don't chew off here more than you can bite before we get the asset pack in 2 weeks
      B) Our primary object of base building is fun that is easy to build for us, so we don't want to spend all this time on something that will be marginally cool and lose precious time and get stuck before the deadline, instead we want to go for aspects that will be immediately fun such as: 
      1. Base building
      2. Life support, acquiring necessary resources to get the colony running
      3. Lots of sim data, stuff that is easy to code, which is just information, CO2 levels, Oxygen levels, water levels, etc, we can always later create fall out effects based on the data already put in place if we want to have some more involved gameplay, and we will in Early Access
      4. Cool visuals, these don't necessarily take long to do, we want to maximize our easy win potential
      5. Look for other easy wins, the player will not know the difference that we needed these to get the game out there
      
      
      
So beware of things that can break last minute before the deadline.



# 10 / 9 / 2019 - The Player!

Let's set up the player, since we already have the asteroids, and we can test the enemy ships last.

So the structure of the player prefab is:

Parent player is actually the ship, the vehicle, which we probably should put under the parent prefab, especially if want to change out ships or something without disturbing the parent player.

So we have the ship which is the parent player.

We also have a rigid body with no gravity and an angular drag of 0.05.


There is also a Mesh Collider, which is a collider that goes off a model mesh, which in this case is called "player_ship_collider", which will be found inside the models folder.

The Mesh Collider is check to convex (not sure what this means, and is trigger, plus cooking options are mixed. No material just the player ship collider.

And then attached is the player controller script onto the parent object. With a speed of 10, and tilt of 5.

Also on the Player script there is a boundary of x min -6, x max 6, and z min of -4, and z max of 8.

If we also went up or down we would have a y min and a y max.

Also there is shot prefab for the "bolt",
Shot spawn: takes shot spawn transform?

And fire rate of .25, which is something we can adjust later when the player unlocks new weapons, but we would like to this by a weapon object, not especially attached to the player controller.

Also seems like we need the prefab in the scene for the astronaut. Perhaps we might be able to generate that from the Resources folder instead in the future, and have the objects hidden off to the side for now.

# 10 / 9 / 2019 - Progress Update


So we are doing really well. We got the asteroids spawning, which from here is a matter of duplicating the process from the other 3 asteroids.

We also have to spawn the ship.

The skybox added a lot of depth to the game. We will also want to instantiate planets here.

The other thing we will need to do is get the player in there, along with the explosions, even if those are place holders, would be helpful to understand the set up and diagram out the process.

So next up:

1) recreate the other 2 asteroids for variety
2) recreate the player
3) recreate the explosions
4) add the enemy ship

There is one enemy ship. Here is the layout of the prefab:


1) The parent object is Enemy Ship and contains:

      A) Rigid body with angular drag to 0.05 and no gravity
      B) Sphere collider
      C) Destroy by contact (this contains the explosions, skip this for now)
      D) Weapon controller (skip this for now)
      E) Mover: -5 (add this)
      F) Evasive Maneuver with settings of x min of -6, x max of 6, and z min of -20, and z max of 20, with tilt of 10, dodge of 5, and 7.5
      G) Sound controller for the laser shots, skip this for, we need much better laser sound effects by the way


Okay we added the other asteroids. 

Now perhaps we want to add the ships first, or take care of the explosions, since those are on the asteroids, well let's do that last, since we can't test without the player.

So add the enemy ship now...




# 10 / 9 / 2019 - Wave Spawning in a Skybox!

Let's add a skybox, and our camera angle to so we can get a sense of the gameplay.

Skybox: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/sky/starfield-skybox-92717


# 10 / 9 / 2019 - Wave Spawning!

Now on to the wave spawning code, to include the actual prefab instantiating in the wave spawning method.

Spawning is updated now, but we need to make a note, for the game over / restart part is included here, add this in later:

      if (State.GAME_OVER)
      { 
          restartText.text = "Press 'R' for Restart";
          restart = true;
          break;
      }
           
           
Wave spawning is working fine, but are these objects being properly garbage disposed of? Assumed there is some area destroy script, but that is not the case. Figure this out later. #TODO

Hard to believe but perhaps garbage collection is not being done on the objects.

So we can do this in a few ways, but the primary way is when this object exists some sort of boundary, then destroy this object. We can use that bullet garbage destroy script, that guy wrote for the dog fighting tutorial. Look up his dog fighting tutorial for the repo.

Now on to creating variety with the other 3 asteroids...
            
            
# 10 / 9 / 2019 - Importing Space Objects


Setting up an asteroid:

Create parent game object.

On the parent game object we will have the rotator and mover.

on the child object we will drag in asteroid model, and apply the materials, plus add a capsule collider.

That's all for the basics, not including the explosions yet.

There is a tumble variable in the "RandomRotator" script which is related to the tumbling factor. Assuming this is in the Asteroid Space Object code folder.

Oh, important: rigid body goes on the parent of the asteroid so we can "tumble" and do other stuff.

Zero out the angular drag on rigid body. Only the ship gets that. And use gravity is set to true.



# 10 / 9 / 2019 - Importing Space Objects

So first let's keep things simple, and just import the models.

Then we want to just spawn models, perhaps with a mover component.

We created a Models folder for all the models from the Space Game, and a Materials folder.


# 10 / 9 / 2019 - Space Object

So there are 3 asteroid prefabs, which will get input into the Hazards[] slot on wave.

The component on each asteroid are the same:

1) Rigid body, mass 1, gravity and is kinematic off
2) Random Rotator with a "Tumble" setting of 5
3) Destroy by Contact
  a) explosion: explosiong_asteroid
  b) player explosion: explosion_player
4) Mover
  -5 (why negative 5 for speed?)
  
  
And the enemy ship is the other space objects in the "hazards" category:

The enemy ship has a tag of "Enemy"

1) Rigid body, mass 1, angular drag of 0.05
2) Sphere collider
3) Destroy By Contact (script)
  a) explosion: explosion_enemy
  b) player explosion: explosion_player
  c) Score value: 20

4) Weapon Controller (script)
  a) shot: bold-enemy
  b) shot spawn: shot spawn (transform)
  c) fire rate: 1.5 (something we could increase in progressing level difficulty)
  d) delay: 0.5
  
5) Evasive Maneuver (script)
  a) Boundary: x min: -6, x max: 6, z min: -20, z max: 20
  b) Tilt: 10 (again we can use tilt and dodge for adjusting level difficulty and variety)
  c) Dodge: 5
  d) Smoothing: 7.5
  e) Start wait: x: 0.5, y 1
  f) maneuver time: x: 1, y: 2
  g) maneuver wait: x: 1: y: 2

6) Audio Source
  a) audio clip: weapon_enemy
  b) play on awake: true


# 10 / 9 / 2019


Okay, so our main question mark was the Hazards[], array, which is just 4 slots (type this in for the size in the inspector), and then we have a combination of 3 asteroids and the enemy ship. So seems like this hazard thing will just spawn whatever, doesn't care what is spawning.

So the question is where will we have this Hazards[] field? Probably on wave? Yes, that's fine.

What is the Spawn Values field? A vector xyz field, perhaps this is the boundary.

# 10 / 9 / 2019

Doing a quick recap of our work, our main action starts in Game.cs, where in StartGame(), all we're doing is starting to spawn the waves.

So go back to recreating the whole demo game from this point, since the foundation is properly setup.

# 10 / 9 / 2019

Today, work but don't stress, just move along. There is no sense of rushing in such a marathon. 

Do things one by one, in the right order, and let that be enough.

So what do we have so far, and how should we structure the work day?

Well, just as a side note, let's do an overview of our different game "play" areas:

1. Main asteroid shooting gameplay
2. Cargo bay for the ship upgrades / base
3. Star map of the galaxy

So we could definitely begin to prototype the transitions.

Keep code clean and simple.


I guess the main object now is to recreate the game.

So import the project folder, and notice the organization, and then try to recreate that.

And then these are the 4 things we want to work toward:

1) Rewritten clean original modible engine, ready for anything
2) Enemy spawning figured out, spawning different enemies during different levels, along with asteroid spawning settings
3) Different weapons accessible to the player, and smooth toggling between, with nice visual effects, weapons work well against certain types of enemies
4) Bonus upgrades, which affect the player can be picked up from the asteroids

<br>

We also want a dedicated Log.cs we can put on the Core. So that we can view that up in the screen, in terms of our game operation, so we know what's what. A few statements here and there never hurt anything.





# 10 / 7 / 2019 - CLEANED UP CODE BASE

We managed to clean up the code base. We have now to just rework Game, and some other dependencies, but we made large stride in rewriting the entire game in our clean code way.

So pretty soon we will have the working demo recreated.

After that is done try to get the bonuses working, and the distinction in the different waves per ship.

For this we will probably use Level.cs, which will be the manager to set the types of ships, and will send parameters, to the Wave spawn functions, such as how many object to spawn, how many asteroids and how many ships.

Then perhaps we will want to do a ship arrangement, and even somehow solve the method of asteroids and ships, which we could spawn at a different time always to cheat, knowing the asteroids speed.

So we will be in good shape, since we will know how to manage the wave spawning, which is a huge component of the game.

Everything we are doing works, is clean, and carries the "no prototypes" mantra.

So keep this method of working, and also create the different weapons for the ships, and maybe even more advanced, different weapons working differently and better / worst against certain types of ships.

Find some free ship models to work with in the meantime, before we get the art assets.

So if we have these things we are doing very good:

1) Rewritten clean original modible engine, ready for anything
2) Enemy spawning figured out, spawning different enemies during different levels, along with asteroid spawning settings
3) Different weapons accessible to the player, and smooth toggling between, with nice visual effects, weapons work well against certain types of enemies
4) Bonus upgrades, which affect the player can be picked up from the asteroids

That will go along way to bringing us to a basic simple MVP.

This should be our only focus for now, and later after the MVP is done we will reasses where to go from here.


# 10 / 7 / 2019 - COMPARASCENTS WITH FASTER THAN LIGHT

Our project is beginning to draw comparascents with the game, Faster Than Light.

The programmer of FTL went through a number of iterations to find the game fun.

The game was very successful even though the project was done with only one programmer, and as a result the scope was small, having most of the gameplay take place in one cross sectional of a space ship! We can also iterate on a simple sequence, with the art we are really not that far off the depth of FTL. However we do need to try to aim for at least as much of a gameplay quality level, along with how the entire project gels together. The good news is that FTL was mega successful, and we have here a recipe for success, especially in light of the talks given by the developer on the process of iteration, and "finding the fun".

# 10 / 7 / 2019 - STAYING ORGANIZED IN THE PROJECT

* a big thing that is easy to overlook is staying continuously organized in the project, which includes:

  - moving purchased assets immediately over to the "store" folder
  - documenting any sort of complex component process, even ones that don't seem complex at the time can be impossible to figure out later
  - documenting attached components with png files, which we can create a folder here, or put those into the architecture folder, labeled as Diagram1.png, Diagram2.png, etc. Where in the architecture we can say, refer to this file. Probably better to have a markup document called "Assembly" in the Architecture folder for when we need to rebuild the project.
  - deleting unecessary stuff
  - making sure things are organized immediately in folders
  - making sure things in the hierarchy are immediately organized under proper game objects
  - keep the game in a continuous state of shippable
  - maintaing a work ethic of always doings things right away in the proper way, and in the proper order, this is KEY!!! Of course we will not be able to do this all the time, and components will need reworking, but this will still make our life easier!!!
  
  * staying organized really does not require that much discipline (but nevertheless requires some), which if we don't do, tidying up the project later will be near impossible! We must stay organized! This also goes for starting with a clean foundation of a code base.

# 10 / 7 / 2019 - ANOTHER KEY THING ABOUT BASE BUILDING: EXPANDS GAMEPLAY + GIVES ANTICIPATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT GAME MODES (COMBAT & BASE BUILDING)

Another key thing about base buidling is that this not only stretches and deepens the dimension of the gameplay, but also creates a sense of anticipation. Here we are playing in the asteroid field, but we are also looking forward to getting the materials needed to upgrade our base (and not to die in the process!). Dying takes on a larger ramification also since we will lose all of our base building materials.

Perhaps this was one of the subliminal elements which made the immediate post initial gameplay boring -- there was nothing to anticipate, nothing to do -- the whole game was already experienced. And players are smart and sense this kind of monotony.

And use roguelike to glue this whole historically proven procedurally randomized game genre. In roguelikes the point isn't really to win but to survive. Perfect since we don't want someone to beat our game in five minutes.

# 10 / 7 / 2019 - TODO

1. Clean up the code base
2. Get the code base to compile
3. Get basic gameplay working (diagram out all components here for reference, and later assembly)
4. Create game elements:
  - ship variety
  - weapon variety
  - bonus upgrades
5. Polish the small core
6. Create the menu
7. Create the HUD
8. Create the titles screen
9. Insert story with skip feature
10. Create the separate scene, or same scene with different camera location for building the space base (the difference doesn't matter, we can redo whether this is in the same scene later)
11. Allow rotating of ship in hangar
12. Allow building basic blocks in hangar view
13. Allow spawning of scientists as capsules, give them basic functions on the navmesh
14. Create the resource gameplay chain, so from destroying asteroids we get minerals we can deposit at the base, which are then used by scientists to research and create new weapons and also upgrade the base, and have more building materials
15. The player can choose whenever they want to go outside for combat, but combat somehow increases in difficulty level. Perhaps we are given the choice to travel to different galaxies, and as we beat one galaxy, then that one flashes off the universe map, so we in essence already beat that level, and we probably won't come back. Also nice to get a different skybox, and that makes sense since we will be in another location of the galaxy map. We can call this the "galaxy map", which will be the world map. This could be a very cool 3D structures which takes advantage of the capabilities of VR. And everyone would LOVE to experience interacting with a star map in VR, especially with game juice, and shiny cool effects.

Then after all this is done reasses what we have so far. This is a pretty good plan, which should not break or impede any future developments.



# 10 / 7 / 2019 - GAME JUICE

A thing that I noticed when beta testers played the game, was that they expected "a lot more". This is fine considering there was really only 2 days spent on getting the basic prototype running. There was a level of initial fun experienced by the players, and then a loss of attention, which is understandable since the game was just started and is rather shallow.

The goal then is to make the game deep, and also provide much more stimulation, and interaction, engaging the player and not allowing them to be bored.

One simple way of doing this is adding **"game juice"**, which is not particularly concerned with game progression, although there will be juice effects for progression.

Go over the game juice YouTube video, and outline all the methods of increasing game juice here.

Another major thing of course is neon lights, which can be found in most modern game trailers. So add lots of that, along with variety, an obvious one being the different laser / weapon types, not on the player, but also the enemy.

Adding a game screen, and intro is another thing that the testers didn't pick up on that diminished their potential game experience. Along with a menu, music, intro story, those will add some real weight to the game.

All these things are easily achievable so outline a method to get these done.

Besides that, the three major things that provide for game fun are:

1. Engagement
2. Progression
3. A sense of wonder


That's why they say to start off by getting your game loop right. The basic game loop does feel right, but there is not enough variety and stimulation to maintain interest levels. So we want to add more gameplay juice like in Enter the Gungeon, Geometry Wars, and other space shooters.

Of course when we add the base engine building aspect that will deepen the gameplay, but we want the basic combat tacticle game part to work independently.

So we will start by polishing the central game part as we go before approaching base building. We probably should spend all this month just polishing the basic combat, and then next month focus on the base building.

Or perhaps we should start right away with simple base building, avoiding any time sinks, and testing that out with gameplay so we can develop the two alongside. That is probably better, although we want to the different types of ships, weapons, and ugprades first, so we can build out the basic architecture to work with the other aspect of the game.

At first the scene transition to the hanger will be simple. There will be a rotating ship, and maybe some basic building, and also spawning workers, so we can begin to start taking care of them.

The workers can then take the titanium, and other minerals we find in asteroids and begin engine building and generating cool stuff for us, that we can then use to upgrade the ship, and also the colony.

The mineral depositing mechanism should have some juice, even if just lights and sound effects, so that we are rewarded for our toils.

Adding this base building aspect will add great variety and make the game a success like XCOM, which if only had one aspect of gameplay would not have done well, yet came out as a unvirsal hit with the proper level of game depth.


# 10 / 7 / 2019 - CLEAN MODULAR DATA DRIVEN EVENT BASED CODE & NO PROTOTYPES! (ENSURES FINAL PRODUCT WORKS)

Something magical happens everytime we do a TODO list or a log. The items get done without necessarily referring back at the list. So this method is very helpful and should be continued.

We managed to clear the first items on the log in such manner.

Next up after setting up a clean modular code foundation will be experimenting with different ships, and bonus upgrades.

And then on down with the list, unless we have to reprioritize.

Take the time to do things right the first time, even if this is selecting an art concept, and documenting the source for quick access later. This saves a lot of time, since these things tend to add up over time.

Again, no prototyping! Even when we get to the hangar and workers, work first toward getting to a simple fun core MVP, so that we are always in a state of a working product, and not a prototype or a tech demo! **This single thing ensures success after the three month workperiod comes to an end.**


# 10 / 7 / 2019 - PERMADEATH IS NECESSARY FOR REPLAYABILITY IN A SMALL GAME

So work through the list below. The good news is that this is all very straightforward.

Another big thing to note, like Cuphead and Spelunky, those games are hard and players say they "love and hate" the game. Of course starting over can be frustrating, but we really need this to give replayability to a small game, and a sense of challenge. So strategically we have to get over the frustration of starting over and just place this roguelike mechanic of permadeath into the game.

One of the top holograms: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/ghosts-and-holograms-91146

And another big thing to note: if a game has roguelike elements, tactics, strategy, base building, worker placement, engine building, tile placement, and is similar to the first historical sensational video game mania of Space Invaders, etc... this is what a Big Mac is... a crowd pleaser... 


# 10 / 7 / 2019 - TODO

Next up: 

1. Order the computer
2. Work on the game while the computer ships (diagram out the code first here, to get the sense of the basic architecture, what does what, and any plans for rework or direction in the future)
3. Try to get the space asset pack to begin work
4. Experiment with the ships in the game, how they look replacing the standard assets, along with the meteors
5. Create two basic levels where we get another ship in the next level
6. Create upgrades, and power ups that we can get when we go over the asteroid, make sure to have interactive (the more interactive the better) audiovisual feedback when we pick up the item, when the item gets dropped, even if this is just a shining light, some particles, whatever
7. Create the intro sequence
8. Create the title screen, even if just a black screen with a title, preferrably against the background of some space thing, so we can immediately tell we are in VR
9. Create the menu screens using the blue SF UI pack, and also use that swoosh noise from the below SF sound effects pack
10. Create a trance playlist song by song, so we can be hands free when we cue up the game instead of having to play the music in the background
11. With the asset pack create different skyboxes for each level
12. Create the HUD for the player, which will have the score, and ammo for now (use the nice SF font stored here)
13. Allow the player to rotate their ship in 3D space in the hangar, or just have the ship be in the hanger, which we can transition to after the level is done, not sure yet if we should transition in the middle of gameplay of a level, maybe when we die, but then we restart the game... not sure
14. Do some major planning of how the base building will work
15. Create the build mechanism for laying down the basic tiles
16. Allow first person navigation in the world
17. So at this point we want to be able to navigate the base, which we build, so we will also want to carry over resources we earn in the tacticle Space Shooter gameplay, to use those to purchase things and build those things
18. Allow some sort of worker placement, which will be dependent on the food we grow and other engine building factors
19. Polish the core game loop -> Title Screen -> Intro (can skip) -> Start Screen -> Tutorial (maybe later) -> Play Game (not sure how we are going to transition between the two, just allow transitioning in the beginning, and then combat mode for one level, and then back to the base, so Base -> Combat -> Base -> Combat -> Base (while we are upgrading each time with our loot)
20. Create minerals from the different asteroids, which we can use for base upgrades, so we can get titanium, gold, etc, and out of those things we will have enough to build our base, and research plant
21. Some of the workers we can dedicate (worker placement) to research, so they help our research tree
22. Create a research tree, even if we have to use basic shapes for the prototype (better to prototype the graphics here than not make any progress toward the research tree)
23. Create all sorts of cool visual weapon effects, and outlines for things with that shader outline tool
24. Although up to here might seem a lot, if we get the above done then we have a very solid foundation to build from, here we want to remind ourselves to just keep polishing as you go, no prototypes!
25. We can create the tutorial with the voice, but to save on time, we could just have a tutorial panel page, which shows everything in Options, all the controls, plus a way to set the controls, and also a way to play with the keyboard if someone doesn't have a game controller

# 10 / 7 / 2019

So even though this might seem like a long drawn out campaign game, this is more similar to a roguelike game such as Spelunky, in that after permadeath we have to restart, which is what keeps players playing, and gives the core replayability to the game. So likewise even though we have this involved environment, the gameplay is like a rogue, where we still start at the beginning and have to build our base over. So our base building, engine building, worker placement, those will be very elegant clean elements like toys, where we can replay like a level of Mario, and still get satisfaction in the basic elements.

People will get a lot of satisfaction just from traversing their space labirynths they create. Even a game like Alice, which is very interesting, there is still some tedium, in trying to figure out how to transverse levels, being stuck in a gray box of the spaceship while you're trying to figure out how to progress, those things are not always particulalry fun, while in this game we give the player a nice Big Mac they can eat right away. The gameplay is immediate, you're right there in space flying, shooting things, building up your base, engine building, worker placement, tile laying -- satisfaction in spades all over. So in that way we can compete in the market. If Spelunky, a 2D game could be such a sensation, we can also create a roguelike in VR with these elements.

* engine building and worker placement, along with tile laying are the most favorite mechanics of board games, so...

* create engine building, worker placement, and tile laying in the ramifications of building up this space colony, kind of like XCOM style, also create this sort of engine that people get satisfactions out of playing Factorio, so we can still have this satisfaction of building our own interactive engine. This doesn't have to be hard to do if well designed

* so, our bio lab affects our stock piles of food, which affects how many colonists we can have, and in turn how many workers we can do worker placement with. Now these effects can be basic yet still gamify the experience and provide the best of Factorio. The trick is to bring out what really is an engine building game, worker placement game etc... In an engine building game "we build an engine", something affects other parts like cogs in a watch. We are trying to create this precise Swiss watch. So this doesn't necessarily require any extra assets than what we have or crazy long pages of code, instead we simply have a state machine, if we have enough plants (which need the proper nutrients fed, etc, some sort of cool VR read of CO2 levels), and then that increases food production, which opens up the requirements to having more workers, so the code is very simple yet very satisfying gameplay emerges

* likewise do this for the tile laying mechanic, a very satisfying way to build

* we are covering the top mechanics of the board game list: worker placement, engine building, and tile laying. Along with also recreating the first video game sensation, Space Invaders, and also going off X-COM the strategy layer with base building, and the tactical combat, which will be in Space Invaders style. So this is a recipe for success.

* can have a cool intro update, "The year was 1996, I was 9 nine years and completely fascinated by the new wave of 3D video games. One of these games was X-COM. I would watch my cousins play (talk about cousins collecting games) Create these blog post updates."

* to handle the complexity first start with the basic game loop, along with the hangar, and no prototypes! just build the game as you go

* so we would have our basic game loop, which would be flying around and getting loot in a rogue procedurally generated Space Invaders environment. After that is done we have the ability to go into our hangar and spin the plane around, which should be no problem at all. At this point we also want to have the menus designed, and the intro story, plus sound effects.

* so that is the absolute basic core we need to start with.

* once that is done we will need to work on some progression mechanisms, and loot drops, and upgrades

* after that add a little more elements to the base, and also add base building, along some sort of grid, or perhaps no grid

* just building our own hangar area will be cool

* after that we will need the colonists, along with the animations, if they are already rigged then this should not be a problem, and we can already create the AI navmesh

* so perhaps we can get the basic hangar and progression of the game going in 20 days

* then in the next month work on the colony simulation

* and the third month polish, and fill in holes

* if we work smart we can get this done

* we could also introduce the concept of biodomes, where we would grow the food

* the trick of not getting lost in growing scope is to pace the game building so we always have an MVP finished product instead of a prototype, so we would first have the full combat tacticle missions done, where we can fly around asteroids, get upgrades and etc, then we would finish the hanger since that is modular, then we would approach every part as a modular piece that will not impede finishing, and then of course we have Early Access

* going along with this concept of a rolling MVP (Agile) we will want to build out the menus, title screen, and the intro early so this will be the base of our MVP and feel like a complete game 


# 10 / 7 / 2019

* we have the primitive asset pack so we can prototype the whole game out, without relying on art packs

* plant out method of prototyping, although we want to have the game in the current ready state at all times, we can still go far with these primitives

* lots of amazing ships we could use here for the final models, and also asteroids, but the pack is $120, so save this until the end: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/polygon-sci-fi-space-pack-138857

* this prototyping pack would be great if we were working on a mario like VR platformer: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/exterior/polygon-prototype-pack-137126

* another cool thing to do would be able to unlock all sorts of ships, and each of the ships have their own upgrade trees, which if planned could work well, this adds further to the replayability of the game, each ship has different abilities, maneuvors, feel of the ship, and weapons, and also sound effects

* would also be nice if the player can collect a few ships and place them in their space hanger, so they can decide which ships to use on which missions

* the other big advantage of the polygon space pack, is that we could use the hanger for the player to walk around and check out their ships, perhaps also let the player assemble their own ships, with the loot that they gain from the space battles, this would really break up the monotony, but there is a risk the player might enjoy the hangar part too much

* perhaps we could even add a little base building to the game, like XCOM, so we would have a few parts:

 1. the combat area
 2. the base / hangar area
 3. universe overview cool area, where we can investigate the different parts of the star system, although this would have to look really cool

* that asset pack also has very cool locking on missle targets, so we could have some lock on missiles, with which we would lock on to the enemy and then send guided missles like in Star Fox, which would add another element to the game

# 10 / 6 / 2019

Very nice style spaceships, but a little too much poly: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/cube-spaceships-pack-01-110342

The spaceship going up and down, while in space might add a nice touch while we are idling. We don't want to do this when we're moving, only idling.

For purchasing items, we could have some sort of inter galactic black market, something out of Neuromancer, with the glowing green 3D objects, some sort of data links, perhaps we purchase plans to print in a 3D printer, etc.

One way of getting free advertising is to send out the game keys to magazines which review games.

Nice pick up items: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/modular-pick-up-items-99720

Check out "Enter the Gungeon", a relatively simple game but a success. Every scene is framed by a neon glowing weapon, we need to do the same: https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/

Study Enter the Gungeon and recreate the same sort of fun gameplay feel, along with Forager.

Also create a very nice research tree in 3D, which the player can orbit around, some sort of Matrix like cyberpunk feel. This will do wonders, namely three things: 1. break up the monotony of the game (perhaps we can choose this between levels) 2. create a research tree upgrade mechanism, adding to the progression and fun of the game, and 3. create strategy

Next to the research tree we could have the cargo bay, in which we can rotate the ship, perhaps add new weapons, check out how they look, and then pull up our tree of upgrades. Then after the player finalizes their selection, they are taken into the next level.

If we could do a really hip research tree like this but in 3D: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/sci-fi-upgrades-window-138966

And on top of this, the 3D VR Research Tree would be easy to do, and would really set the game apart.

Put a lot time in making the weapons feel good, like the creators from Dead Cells.

Also have some sort of orbiting glowing balls going around in nice circular patterns for the player to dodge.

Use Lerp and sine wave functions, and smooth damp and others to get a very smooth effect going in lots of things, so the game just feels great.

Also need a professional art cover, like Enter the Gungeon. We could have pilots, and perhaps aliens and ships, something very worth of Space Commander, like a cross between enter the Gungeon, and the Super Mario Land / Warrio box cover.

Make the best possible game in 3 months, ready for Early Access. This will pay off.

Also use a nice lighting effect, with beautify, or the light set up from Space Journey, to really make the glowing lights pops in the darkness, and against the space backgrounds.

Showing just darkness of course will not sell the game, but if we have all sorts of hologrpahic light effects, along with asteroids, and space ships, and lots of fast movement, that will sell the game.

We could do some triangular arrow like weapon, that has a nice coverage area. Very useful for getting ride of a lot of things in one area, so this would be used in harder levels, and have limited ammo.

We want to create a way for the player to use strategy in what weapons they use, so that they don't waste the weapons, and also for the player to triage and manage strategy with the rogue procedurally generating engine. So they will need to get a feel for the drop and spawn rate of objects.

There is anice sound effect for the menu we could use in the below sound effect pack.

* lots of high quality weapon effects, we definitely want to use this: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/sci-fi-vfx-91983

* search asset store for "laser sound effects", "laser sounds"

* here is a volumetric laser we could do something with: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/volumetric-laser-beam-40969

* also search for "laser weapon(s)", "laser beams": https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/laser-beams-weapon-systems-pack-18138

* this has an AMAZING laser beam weapon we can use, and the cool idea of using rotating mines: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/space-weapons-vfx-152817

* mines could also be deployed by enemies


* amazing free pack of SF sound effects: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/weapons/sci-fi-weapon-sfx-by-great-heights-audio-147911


* some very high quality shader particle effects / weapons: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/sci-fi-vfx-91983

* these SF sound effects for weapons are not bad: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/weapons/sci-fi-weapon-sound-effects-pack-1-106514

* search more for "sci fi" sounds, and also "sci fi weapons" sounds

* a very nice asset pack with a space base we can use in the terraforming game, even though we might use Unreal and port the art over: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/sci-fi-styled-modular-pack-82913

* even simple building and cultivation of life in deep space, (mining planet for resources with large overhead machines, etc), could be very nice to start off the VR terraforming game

* just experiencing stuff like this in VR would be awe inspiring: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/sci-fi-heavy-station-kit-hangars-augmented-147104

* this asset is very nice at procedurally generating tons of space environments: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/level-design/space-for-unity-space-scene-construction-kit-7095

* a few things to take away from the above asset, we can use space rings like saturn in the near distance to show off the VR effect in one of the levels, also space fog

* SF sound effects, should be easy to find tons of stuff: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/sci-fi-sound-effects-pack-4-106530

* hologram particles: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/hologram-particles-45196

* search the asset store for "hologram"

* hologram pyramid: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/hologram-pyramid-61735

* another nice hologram

* this hologram is very nice, we could use this for mapping the entire territory or something: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/hologram-shader-25876

* we could also use that for hologram for the ship in scan mode or something

* another nice hologram: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/sci-fi-hologram-shader-77666

* we have nice power ups to try out for free: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/powerup-particles-16458

* these will be revealed when some asteroids and or ships are destroyed

* an easy power up to do is triple lasers, perhaps this power up is time based like in Mario, so we don't just give you something forever, which would lower the perceived value of the gift

* there are some nice particle effects that we can try out, go through these and jot down what is useable for each

* the ship model is really nice looking, and we can replace our current ship with that model

* from the same asset creator, there is a nice ship pack we can use to start out with for the enemies

* we will definitely need different skyboxes for each level

* we need lots of progression, and a sense of wonder to make the game fun

* create the intro story mode with a skip button for fast gameplay

* we need a nice overlay GUI, which tells us our score, and how much ammo we have

* here is a nice power ups set: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/power-up-fx-152740 and https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/sci-fi-powerup-item-crate-18990 and https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/spells/loot-drop-fx-147479

* we just need to keep iterating on the powerups to make them look badass

* although we are not directly going for retro, we could have all sorts of updated sounds, when things rev up, exponential stuff like the logic trick, where you can add the exponential decay to create some cool sounds, the effects are important, spend a lot of time on the sound effects, even if we have to create them ourselves

* these are some very cool radar shaders we can use: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/silhouette-radar-shaders-97229

* definitely use the radar shaders, adds a lot of oomph to the game, use for: when an enemy takes damage they flash like this, perhaps when our shields, or the inner core of the ship takes damage we flash this, we can use different color for variety and situations, even some heavier asteroids might flash this color if we are trying to penetrate to the goodies, this effect definitely looks amazing in VR so use this

* we need lots of audiovisual candy like the above shader, this is paramount for a game like this, use all the sugar tricks they say to use, so make the lasers bigger, more powerful, delay the enemy slightly if they take damage, fine tune and polish in order of priorites

* we could even move the player to a different angle or spot of the galaxy that we are fighting for some more adrenalin rushing moments, although we need to keep constant velocity without acceleration (or teleportation), and ask the player before we do this, not sure if we will even use this

* so go through this list and organize tasks in order of importance

* universal sound effects library: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/universal-sound-fx-17256

* have the game oozing with sound, keep feeding the player with new stimulus so they don't get bored

* here is a very nice shield effect, which even shows taking damage: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/energy-shield-effect-with-transition-and-hit-response-100109

* here are lots of visual effects: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/ultimate-vfx-26701

* go for things that make the most impact, these will be: 
  * intro
  * SF menu
  * powerups
  * shields
  * progression / variety (weapons, skyboxes, enemies, asteroids, worlds, powerups, anything, list out how we can use progression for all of the noteworthy stuff)
  
  * nice forcefield: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/spells/forcefield-effects-123431
  
  * some cool things we could do with the hexagons: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/spells/living-particles-105817
  
  * this would feel like "Geometry Walls" where with progression difficulty we want to overwhelm the players sense, but we also want to have holographic light effects right from the start to ground them
  
  * light effects are especially good for trailers
  
  * nice warehouse environment for future games: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/industrial/warehouse-environment-110654
  
 <br>
 
 So we will want to have enemy formations, like in classic space shooter games, this will be cool because we can line up formations, we might need to rewrite or amend the code from the ground up so the forces don't collider with asteroids, or maybe they also take damage from asteroids, or their shields take damage, that would be an easy solution instead of having to write AI to dodge asteroids.
 
 We will want to create variety, and overwhelm the player with progression right away, so they do not get bored easily!!!

Again the goal is to make a game that is like the Big Mac meal of games. So something quick, very easily accessible by people of all ages and creeds, something that shows off VR immediately. We would also like a short type of arcade gameplay, which people can use to introduce their friends to VR, because they don't want to just sit by ackwardly while their friends are in VR. So if they get a quick mega rush taste of VR, that will be enough to get them excited, and this will be a good proper party game people can use for a quick VR session. VR also wears on the user, so quick sessions are not a bad thing.

The other big thing is that we want to use Rogue elements for fun and replayability:
 * randomly spawned terrain (asteroids and etc) and enemiews
 * random items, sometimes you might get the item that saves you and sometimes you might not
 * permadeath, have to start over, helps with increasing playability of a small game, so players don't just easily beat and experience everything on the first try
 
 We could also use the roguelike genre description as a selling point of a game.
 
 "Space Game" is an homage to the space shooter genre along with roguelike elements. This game is perfect as a "party" game where you would like to show off your VR system to a friend.
 

This almost a futuristic game reimagined from the 80s on modern technology.
 
 
 * define the game's architecture as an early TODO
 
Interesting things:

1. physics propulsion system: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/b-propulsion-system-96220
2. physics lab: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/forces-physics-lab-135734
3. simple physics toolkit: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/simple-physics-toolkit-magnet-water-wind-vr-ready-53912
4. flight simulator: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/silantro-flight-simulator-toolkit-128025


* very nice cube city we could use to make a Fez type game in VR. Very simple building:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/kubikos-3d-cube-city-147691


* another very nice city asset pack: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/backstreet-cube-pack-137610

* could totally make a mini game with these, the streets would have to be built one by one, and with simple sims perhaps

* and yet another great simple town asset, and free, which is begining to give a sense of aesthetic, of what a "small" city building game could be like, along with worker placement: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/cartown-136585

* kind of like if we took Kingdoms and Castles, and made that in a modern city building environment, along with VR, and players being able to play both versions

* along with that is "Simple Sky": https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/simple-sky-cartoon-assets-42373

* simple assets like Kingdoms and Castles are great, because we can still make a game, which doesn't seem small, and yet have the ability to easily create more of these low poly primitive assets

* great asset for prototyping: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/primitive-150-108758

# 10 / 5 / 2019

* begin on order of tasks in the design document

* get to MVP ASAP

# 10 / 4 / 2019

* creating the design document

* trying to keep the design document more lean this time, since this is a different type of game, and this method of working is easier
