# MARKETING

* the whole marketing page could be just: VOLUME, VOLUME, VOLUME

* the goal is to simply send out as much marketing as measured in volume

* marketing is creating a game that is marketable

* good games are easy to market

* free demo on steam will do wonders for marketing

* send out press and promotional releases to streamers, and also VR enthusiasts on the net

* with a demo, we don't even need to send out keys, but we still can so streamer can excitedly tell the viewers (give them value) that the game is also available as a free demo, can't resist


# ORGANIC ADVERTISING

A simple cool thing we could do, is take one of our interesting log posts, and write up a game dev / general gamer audience article, which would go into cool nitty gritty details while advertising the game. This would feel very natural and work in tune with how we want to present on reddit, namely that post write ups do much better than external article links.



# EASY MONEY

Game developers are usually not very good at advertising, which is usually not within their skillset. But if we look at this from the perspective of: if we just write this blog post we will instantly generate a few thousand dollars of sales in the next few days -- that will be motivation enough to work on marketing and writing up these articles, or sending press kits out, or whatever else we can do advertise the game.


# PROOFREAD, PROOFREAD, PROOFREAD

Make sure to utilize all the writing craftsmanship when writing a blog post, or marketing copy. Edit the writing a number of times, read out loud, set aside for a few days, and then read out loud again, continuously layering your talent and improving the quality bar. An always interesting element is insight, so that we do not dare to waste the reader's time.

# FTL Article

We just wrote a log post on comparing the game to FTL, and the developer's iteration process of "finding the fun". We could write up a blog post how we were inspired by this GDC talk, summarize and expand on the GDC talk relating back on the game. We could set this up on our website, and organically drive traffic. This is an ofter overlooked way of generating some really good traffic. The Internet is your backyard sandbox! Take advantage of the user friendliness of technology in the 21st century and bring your traffic to you! 

This can simply be done with writing informative blog posts (could be signed undersome developer nickname), and these would organically drive traffic to the site!

The blog posts wouldn't have to be just about games but like Yung Yea, although in a much less gossipy fashion, write about anything game related, which would then drive traffic. So we could have all sorts stuff, where we don't even mention the game, but just writing about the game would drive traffic.

In fact, we should probably begin writing these blog posts sooner rather than later, and then have some sort of standard signature, like "Notch is the developer of Space Game, a space building game inspired by classic space shooters. Wishlist the game on Steam here: <link>." And bam! We are in!

We can also have the user sign up their email address to be notified. Make this very easy for the user to input their email address. 

This will do wonders for the marketing of the game!

# An Entry to the Large Clubhouse of Reddit/r/Gaming

We can focus on the article more on how the developers of FTL, found the fun, so something like, "Fun, game iteration, and the struggles of FTL to make an indie game."

And here we could do some major, but EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING analysis (to draw a crowd), and then link back to our game, which we would get two things right away 1) exposure 2) higher google search algorithm SEO ranking.

# Not Just the Usual Suspects

Instead of going after the gaming crowd on Reddit, we can go for the ENTIRE Internet crowd.

We could do this by linking to very large and on outside appearance, general (blog) articles. That's what they really are, blog articles, but blog articles could be out of fashion, and we could use a different name, maybe even articles.

Kind of like a collection of articles that Terry Rossio would write for Wordplayer.com

We should also have a website that is perhaps the name of the company, and not the game, so we can keep this name around for more projects, while we drive traffic to this one central location, the game company site.


Some examples of "big concept topics", which would have the potential of attracting the largest crowd possible would be: 

- technology anything related, doesn't even have to be specific to the game, or game dev (but can be)
- VR
- look at what is trending in technology and write about the cool things, which are not necessarily controversial, leave a good feeling afterward, and are of utmost interest to readers.

Especially if we can somehow link one of the top searches, and crank out the article quickly to generate traffic.

Study what gets a lot of traffic in the realm of technology. Also rank the top posts of all time in Reddit / technology / gaming, and all the slew of related tech communities. Copy what they did. If we have just a few of these breakouts the game could go viral just on this basis.

One example of this is simply writing about VR technology, which is really exciting.

Can then post these VR articles on VR forums, easily get free upvotes and exposure, and link back to the product on the site, and then request to wishlist on Steam, simply by having a link: Wishlist Space Game on Steam. Make this an obvious link, and something super convenient for the user to do. Also have a link to the store page.

# An Example of a Far Reaching Big Concept Article

An example of a big concept article which could draw a large crowd, would be an updated review of Neuromancer by William Gibson. In there we could explore the updated ideas of VR, the Matrix, ideas in the book Cyberia, also mention interesting factoids about how VR started, quoting even the book on VR, which we should be able to do with fair use.

So we could quote Cyberia, Neuromancer, and the VR book, really giving the people a very high quality read.

# Another Example of a Far Reaching Big Concept Article

Another example could be an article on the coming new Matrix film. We could do a lot of research, have really pleasant to read content like on Medium, but custom made for us, we could also give the readers a proper grounding and refresher of the Matrix storyline, by studying all the YouTube videos, and then outline this in a very nice format for readers, basically have the single most informative article on the Internet on the upcoming movie. 

Then we could post that Matrix article on a whole nice of subreddits.

This would garner a lot of views. We can set up a counter on the website to measure traffic.

# Collecting Big Concept Ideas

These big concept ideas are good but they are hard to find if we search for them. Like generating game ideas, we should have a document here dedicated to collecting these big concept ideas as they occur to us.

In the meantime we can just keep pumping out articles on Cyberpunk and the Matrix.

And later who knows, we could collect these writings in a book about Cyberpunk and the new coming realities of the Information Age.

Also if we put an anthropological twist on a lot of the stuff, especially that we can sign our name saying we received a degree in anthropology (when the user clicks on About the author, or some author signature, the author studied anthropology and received a bachelor's of anthropology), this gives us credence to write about these things, especially when we talk about how in a few short years the Internet has completely changed our way of life drastically the first time in a few hundred thousand years...

Also in the about section the author receieved his degree in anthropology, and is currently developing a game in VR. Wishlist the game on Steam here, or go here for the link.

# Marketing Personality and Website

The website title should be something catchy this is a "catch all" phrase for both the game development company and also the symposium of articles on the state of technology in the 21st century.

So we could say the author is a game developer, to attract attention and give some credence along with the anthropology background.

We could even have a general article which is Anthropology and Technology. What would make us stand out right away from the crowd, is by providing professional citations. Articles with lots of citations rise up as cream of the crop to the top of the Google search algorithm.

# Anthropology and Technology

We could have a general article on how all of the different ways technology has changed our lives from an anthropological perspective.

# Getting Users to Sign Up

We can have users be notified when a new article comes out, or enter your email to be notified when new articles are published, or when there are new updates to the game.

# Trashy Ads

In the beginning we don't want any ads on the website so the site does not seem trashy. We will get more traffic this way, and the real product is the game.

# Research SEO Techniques

* this is key, and something we can list on our resume

# How to Write Quicly While Writing Well

* use the techniques in How to Write Quickly While Writing Well to plan out and diagram articles, for cohesion and writing speed

# Book Publishing Deal

* write each of the articles in such a way that we can create a whole book out of placing the seemingly organic articles in a sequential chapter manner (even planning out series of articles with an overarching theme before hand, like Cyberia, with a title like Virtual Realities, Cyberpunk, and the ..., a very cool anthropological title), something that we could file away in anthropology or technology. Then when the VR game is done, we should have a much easier time of getting a book published with all of these articles. So this would be a book on topics in tech and anthropology with a lose theme of cyberpunk, so we would just collect those articles which would cover the topic, such as Matrix, Neuromancer, Cyberia, VR, etc.

And of course the book would result in extra advertising for the game.

# On Neuromancer

Skim Neuromancer, and list out all the visionary ideas, some of which came true, some of which didn't, and some of which might. We could use this wording to delineate these three categories.

# On Combining Philosophy

Also use a lot of philosophy. One way of doing this is simply talking about the ideas of philosophers, and quoting famous philosophers, which immediately gives our work a philosophical edge, which can be enjoyed by many.

# Book Title

Have a cool book title, like Brave New Technoworld: Journeys in the Dark Labyrinth of 21st Technology.

This lends to all the dark undercurrents of modern tech, so on biotech we could draw inspiration from Michael Crichton and his work on Next.


# The Literary Edge

Not only use philosophy heavily, but also quote the ideas, thoughts, and works of literary authors to make the worker higher class.

# Book Topics

* pull out cyberpunky and anthrotech (perhaps coin this word), topics from the articles kind of like in the style of Cyberia

* mention the idea of information doubling, how from the renaissance to the 70s technology doubled, etc

* above all try to gain the reader's interest

* hot technology is always going to be high up on the bestseller's list, especially that now the trend is going toward more nonfiction writing than fiction writing

* feature tons of philosophy like Zizek, who repeats all the good ideas to garner interest

* feature tons of literary references, and literary theory

* really ground the reader in modern theory to expand their horizons

* expand the reader's horizons on every step

* have a cool organization to the book like the biologist often does, Wilson and also Michael Crichton

* speak a lot about Michael Crichton's work, and his cautionary tales of technology, introducing him as the science fiction techno thriller writer of Jurassic Park
