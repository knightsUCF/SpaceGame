# MARKETING

* the whole marketing page could be just: VOLUME, VOLUME, VOLUME

* the goal is to simply send out as much marketing as measured in volume

* marketing is creating a game that is marketable

* good games are easy to market

* free demo on steam will do wonders for marketing

* send out press and promotional releases to streamers, and also VR enthusiasts on the net

* with a demo, we don't even need to send out keys, but we still can so streamer can excitedly tell the viewers (give them value) that the game is also available as a free demo, can't resist


# ORGANIC ADVERTISING

A simple cool thing we could do, is take one of our interesting log posts, and write up a game dev / general gamer audience article, which would go into cool nitty gritty details while advertising the game. This would feel very natural and work in tune with how we want to present on reddit, namely that post write ups do much better than external article links.
