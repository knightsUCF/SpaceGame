# BIG WIN

* the developer of Forager said they were able to get 300K downloads of their demo on Itch.

* do the same thing, offer the demo gameplay with both VR and regular on Itch for free

* the Steam algorithm loves people who create an account just to buy your game


# MARKETING

* the whole marketing page could be just: VOLUME, VOLUME, VOLUME

* the goal is to simply send out as much marketing as measured in volume

* marketing is creating a game that is marketable

* good games are easy to market

* free demo on steam will do wonders for marketing

* send out press and promotional releases to streamers, and also VR enthusiasts on the net

* with a demo, we don't even need to send out keys, but we still can so streamer can excitedly tell the viewers (give them value) that the game is also available as a free demo, can't resist


# ORGANIC ADVERTISING

A simple cool thing we could do, is take one of our interesting log posts, and write up a game dev / general gamer audience article, which would go into cool nitty gritty details while advertising the game. This would feel very natural and work in tune with how we want to present on reddit, namely that post write ups do much better than external article links.



# EASY MONEY

Game developers are usually not very good at advertising, which is usually not within their skillset. But if we look at this from the perspective of: if we just write this blog post we will instantly generate a few thousand dollars of sales in the next few days -- that will be motivation enough to work on marketing and writing up these articles, or sending press kits out, or whatever else we can do advertise the game.


# PROOFREAD, PROOFREAD, PROOFREAD

Make sure to utilize all the writing craftsmanship when writing a blog post, or marketing copy. Edit the writing a number of times, read out loud, set aside for a few days, and then read out loud again, continuously layering your talent and improving the quality bar. An always interesting element is insight, so that we do not dare to waste the reader's time.

# FTL Article

We just wrote a log post on comparing the game to FTL, and the developer's iteration process of "finding the fun". We could write up a blog post how we were inspired by this GDC talk, summarize and expand on the GDC talk relating back on the game. We could set this up on our website, and organically drive traffic. This is an ofter overlooked way of generating some really good traffic. The Internet is your backyard sandbox! Take advantage of the user friendliness of technology in the 21st century and bring your traffic to you! 

This can simply be done with writing informative blog posts (could be signed undersome developer nickname), and these would organically drive traffic to the site!

The blog posts wouldn't have to be just about games but like Yung Yea, although in a much less gossipy fashion, write about anything game related, which would then drive traffic. So we could have all sorts stuff, where we don't even mention the game, but just writing about the game would drive traffic.

In fact, we should probably begin writing these blog posts sooner rather than later, and then have some sort of standard signature, like "Notch is the developer of Space Game, a space building game inspired by classic space shooters. Wishlist the game on Steam here: <link>." And bam! We are in!

We can also have the user sign up their email address to be notified. Make this very easy for the user to input their email address. 

This will do wonders for the marketing of the game!

# An Entry to the Large Clubhouse of Reddit/r/Gaming

We can focus on the article more on how the developers of FTL, found the fun, so something like, "Fun, game iteration, and the struggles of FTL to make an indie game."

And here we could do some major, but EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING analysis (to draw a crowd), and then link back to our game, which we would get two things right away 1) exposure 2) higher google search algorithm SEO ranking.

# Not Just the Usual Suspects

Instead of going after the gaming crowd on Reddit, we can go for the ENTIRE Internet crowd.

We could do this by linking to very large and on outside appearance, general (blog) articles. That's what they really are, blog articles, but blog articles could be out of fashion, and we could use a different name, maybe even articles.

Kind of like a collection of articles that Terry Rossio would write for Wordplayer.com

We should also have a website that is perhaps the name of the company, and not the game, so we can keep this name around for more projects, while we drive traffic to this one central location, the game company site.


Some examples of "big concept topics", which would have the potential of attracting the largest crowd possible would be: 

- technology anything related, doesn't even have to be specific to the game, or game dev (but can be)
- VR
- look at what is trending in technology and write about the cool things, which are not necessarily controversial, leave a good feeling afterward, and are of utmost interest to readers.

Especially if we can somehow link one of the top searches, and crank out the article quickly to generate traffic.

Study what gets a lot of traffic in the realm of technology. Also rank the top posts of all time in Reddit / technology / gaming, and all the slew of related tech communities. Copy what they did. If we have just a few of these breakouts the game could go viral just on this basis.

One example of this is simply writing about VR technology, which is really exciting.

Can then post these VR articles on VR forums, easily get free upvotes and exposure, and link back to the product on the site, and then request to wishlist on Steam, simply by having a link: Wishlist Space Game on Steam. Make this an obvious link, and something super convenient for the user to do. Also have a link to the store page.

# An Example of a Far Reaching Big Concept Article

An example of a big concept article which could draw a large crowd, would be an updated review of Neuromancer by William Gibson. In there we could explore the updated ideas of VR, the Matrix, ideas in the book Cyberia, also mention interesting factoids about how VR started, quoting even the book on VR, which we should be able to do with fair use.

So we could quote Cyberia, Neuromancer, and the VR book, really giving the people a very high quality read.

# Another Example of a Far Reaching Big Concept Article

Another example could be an article on the coming new Matrix film. We could do a lot of research, have really pleasant to read content like on Medium, but custom made for us, we could also give the readers a proper grounding and refresher of the Matrix storyline, by studying all the YouTube videos, and then outline this in a very nice format for readers, basically have the single most informative article on the Internet on the upcoming movie. 

Then we could post that Matrix article on a whole nice of subreddits.

This would garner a lot of views. We can set up a counter on the website to measure traffic.

# Collecting Big Concept Ideas

These big concept ideas are good but they are hard to find if we search for them. Like generating game ideas, we should have a document here dedicated to collecting these big concept ideas as they occur to us.

In the meantime we can just keep pumping out articles on Cyberpunk and the Matrix.

And later who knows, we could collect these writings in a book about Cyberpunk and the new coming realities of the Information Age.

Also if we put an anthropological twist on a lot of the stuff, especially that we can sign our name saying we received a degree in anthropology (when the user clicks on About the author, or some author signature, the author studied anthropology and received a bachelor's of anthropology), this gives us credence to write about these things, especially when we talk about how in a few short years the Internet has completely changed our way of life drastically the first time in a few hundred thousand years...

Also in the about section the author receieved his degree in anthropology, and is currently developing a game in VR. Wishlist the game on Steam here, or go here for the link.

# Marketing Personality and Website

The website title should be something catchy this is a "catch all" phrase for both the game development company and also the symposium of articles on the state of technology in the 21st century.

So we could say the author is a game developer, to attract attention and give some credence along with the anthropology background.

We could even have a general article which is Anthropology and Technology. What would make us stand out right away from the crowd, is by providing professional citations. Articles with lots of citations rise up as cream of the crop to the top of the Google search algorithm.

# Anthropology and Technology

We could have a general article on how all of the different ways technology has changed our lives from an anthropological perspective.

# Getting Users to Sign Up

We can have users be notified when a new article comes out, or enter your email to be notified when new articles are published, or when there are new updates to the game.

# Trashy Ads

In the beginning we don't want any ads on the website so the site does not seem trashy. We will get more traffic this way, and the real product is the game.

# Research SEO Techniques

* this is key, and something we can list on our resume

# How to Write Quicly While Writing Well

* use the techniques in How to Write Quickly While Writing Well to plan out and diagram articles, for cohesion and writing speed

# Book Publishing Deal

* write each of the articles in such a way that we can create a whole book out of placing the seemingly organic articles in a sequential chapter manner (even planning out series of articles with an overarching theme before hand, like Cyberia, with a title like Virtual Realities, Cyberpunk, and the ..., a very cool anthropological title), something that we could file away in anthropology or technology. Then when the VR game is done, we should have a much easier time of getting a book published with all of these articles. So this would be a book on topics in tech and anthropology with a lose theme of cyberpunk, so we would just collect those articles which would cover the topic, such as Matrix, Neuromancer, Cyberia, VR, etc.

And of course the book would result in extra advertising for the game.

# On Neuromancer

Skim Neuromancer, and list out all the visionary ideas, some of which came true, some of which didn't, and some of which might. We could use this wording to delineate these three categories.

# On Combining Philosophy

Also use a lot of philosophy. One way of doing this is simply talking about the ideas of philosophers, and quoting famous philosophers, which immediately gives our work a philosophical edge, which can be enjoyed by many.

# Book Title

Have a cool book title, like Brave New Technoworld: Journeys in the Dark Labyrinth of 21st Technology.

This lends to all the dark undercurrents of modern tech, so on biotech we could draw inspiration from Michael Crichton and his work on Next.


# The Literary Edge

Not only use philosophy heavily, but also quote the ideas, thoughts, and works of literary authors to make the worker higher class.

# Book Topics

* pull out cyberpunky and anthrotech (perhaps coin this word), topics from the articles kind of like in the style of Cyberia

* mention the idea of information doubling, how from the renaissance to the 70s technology doubled, etc

* above all try to gain the reader's interest

* hot technology is always going to be high up on the bestseller's list, especially that now the trend is going toward more nonfiction writing than fiction writing

* feature tons of philosophy like Zizek, who repeats all the good ideas to garner interest

* feature tons of literary references, and literary theory

* really ground the reader in modern theory to expand their horizons

* expand the reader's horizons on every step

* have a cool organization to the book like the biologist often does, Wilson and also Michael Crichton

* speak a lot about Michael Crichton's work, and his cautionary tales of technology, introducing him as the science fiction techno thriller writer of Jurassic Park, giving the reader some real quotes from Michael Crichton's character who speak cautionary of technology, especially Ian Malcolm, also mention that symbolically this is Michael Crichton featuring his altergo, or we could very well suppose that Ian Malcolm is Michael Crichton's alterego, a voice piece for his cautionary woes of humankind's often doomed to failure quest of harnessing technology


# An Intro Article for the Book and Website

* a general article on anthrotech titled, "Brave New Techworld", could be a proper intro to the website, and also be the first chapter of the book

* here we would outline the major themes in the tech trends of today from an anthropological perspective, which would set the tone for the further articles in the book

* of course later we could rewrite this article as a proper first chapter

# Getting an Agent

Of course we want to take the proper route and get an agent instead of self publishing. We could however continue to self promote, but we really need an agent to get the best deal, hopefully a bidding war, and also get the book in bookstores, and also featured on lists.

In the agent cover letter mention being editor in chief of the paper, studying creative writing in college, and other things to give immediate credence. Then mention that you just published a VR game to give even further credence, and of course mention you got a degree in anthropology so you are writing in this genre of "anthrotech", making up the word unashamedly.

# Book Chapters

* Brave New Techworld anthro intro, (first chapter could be called "A Brave New Techworld". Mention Michael Crichton a lot (with a nice young picture), since he was the leading techno thriller pop culture author, and he was also an anthropologist, and his general opinion of technology in all of his books lines up with the theme of the cautionary tale of technology, our quest to harness our new powers, (use some mythology here how someone tried to get too much power at their detrmine, Icarus? That's a common one, try to find others, that people haven't heard about), and this goes well with the title "Brave New Techworld" the human 2.0, (could be the title of the next chapter), get discord chat on talking about the hive mind of discord, and the human 2.0, also use the Alice example, where strangers come by and just join in the tea conversation with no strange side glances if you did something like this in public, going back to Crichton, use lots of work in this chapter, so speak of things from State of Fear, from his first works of tech failing, to Jurassic Park, and chaos theory how the complexity of technology is hard to reign in, etc, great jumping off point, the dangers of biotech in Next, , mention being a programmer on working on a VR game in the first chapter, perhaps even in story mode "I was doing x and then y happened" a few years earlier i had no idea studying anthropology would somehow still be relevant in the tech world, or a big shortage of anthropological work, or not much, perhaps because of how quickly technology is changing, and how much, mention how in the past you could be a renaissance man with deep knowledge ver many discipliness, but now this is impossibly with the proliferation of disciplines, wide and deep, this is also good for the book, since we are basically foreshadowing we will guide the reader through the proliferation of all these genres. Another good thing about introducing yourself early as a VR programmer is that will give you some clout, "they know what they're talking about" for the rest of the book, to write with a very advanced perspective on these complex topics, also relate Michael Crichton being an "early adopter" of technology with his book on computing, "Electronic Life". This is a huge metaphor for this book! Find the best experts in that book, and mention how even wrote a plot generator for his novels and other apps with the source code provided in the back of his book. How we went from being scared of computers (from the perspective of who he wrote the book for, people who were scared of machines as one group) to being scared to live without them, experiencing anxiety when we are without our smart phones, now our lives are the "Electronic Life". When we finish with the different books of Crichton, we want to end up on "Electronic Life", since this brings everything in and thematically ties into the flow and transition of this nonfiction work.
* Some more anthropology on how we evolved to our current state of a dependence on technology
* The Postmodern Human, how anthrotech is changing the world
* The Information Age, how we got here and where we are going, speak of the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, etc, in an anthropological sense, ending on the Information Age, also mention Claude Shannon, since we are a programmer, and mention his advances which along with the computer led to the Information Age, also talk about Ada Lovelace, the first programmer, her story is a treat, and could be a book
* The Death of the Old Order, (might need a less aggressive title) mention how newspapers have been replaced by the Internet, focus in this chapter on the industries that have been wiped away by monopolization, Amazon, which no one believed in the beginning that people would want to buy books on the Internet, and in 20 years most could hardly imaging having to pay retail when the could have the books conviently delivered to their door steps
* Cyberpunk, a resurgence of cyberpunk with William Gibson, which ideas were put on hold, alluding to Bitcoin and cryptos, which will transition into the next chapter. Talk about how cyberpunk is a relatively small genre compared to science fiction, like sword and sorcery is to fantasy. Explain in fantasy the hero is trying to save the world, in sword and sorcery the hero is barely able to save himself, not concerned with the big picture because of the realization they are alone and helpless in a big and at times hostile world, similar to noir, how we are focused on regular folk, trying to get by in the nameless shades of the modern world, lost in the crowd, fighting for survival
* The Streamer Sensation, how regular people are using the Internet to connect with people all over the world, a whole new paradigm of journalism, communication, "techno tribes", this like technology is not just a linear improvement, this is a quantum leap, a sudden great leap forward on an exponential scale, mention how single people can now make tons of money streaming from their such niche interest that would have a hard time garner consideration just a few years ago
* Techno Tribes, how modern technology is creating decentralized asynchronous techno tribes, groups of people who come together in a shared interest on the Internet, speak of chess as one of the examples of this, how people are using Twitch for such niche communities as chess, the whole fascinating spectacle of the thing, where else would we have thousands of people watching a chess match and commentating in real time
* Cryptocurrency, mention that one "Cryptonomicon" on the Internet, which seemed to foretell cryptocurrency, speak of decentralized exchanges, go into the max nitty gritty, people will enjoy this stuff coming from a programmer, go over ICOs, explain very clearly how crypto works, the origins, read the crypto book by that one Greek guy, in general give the audience a very informative, yet easy to read an entertaining experience
* Autonomous Electric Vehicles, cover Tesla, self driving cars, Google tech, the wonders of modern GPS
* <good place for more light stuff here>
* Food engineering / production
* Graphene - the wonder material
* Decentralized knowledge gatherers, wikinomics book, how wiki helps, take ideas from that book
* AI, mention all the nuances of AI tech, and how this whole thing works to a laymen, the big leap, and go over the AI Winter in the beginning, how we were excited about AI, and then no progress was made, until two things which occured recently 1. Developments in Big Data 2. Computing power
* 3D printing
* Quantum computers, finish the chapter with some conjecture on what would happen if the AI came online with the power of a quantum computer, and learned everything instantly...?
* From Gaming to Reality, talk about how the early games were just fun amusements, and now they are taking over, with games being a bigger industry than film and Hollywood
* VR, where we mention our game, and the history of VR, especially the interesting Facebook drama, quoting the VR book, if we pull out the best parts from the Oculus book we will have a riveting chapter
* Experiences inside the Matrix, connect back now cyberpunk from the earlier William Gibson chapter, also jot down that Matrix Book
* New Paradigms Brought by Tech, talk about how technology is changing our perceptions of the world, mentioning the best ideas in that book Sync, and also the Science of Impossibilty
* Michael Crichton's Technothrillers, write how we are naturally predisposed to see the worst in things, but this is generally not a bad thing because we can be more careful about technology
* Transition with Michael Crichton's NEXT into Biotech, and Bioethics
* Neuralink, the things we can do with our minds
* Chapter on Craig Venter and his work to use technology to create life in the lab
* Outer Space and Elon Musk, colonizing the moon and mars, mention India and China's efforts to have moon and mars bases
* finish with "Where from Here with Accelerating Change" mention how predicting the future is notoriously difficult, opening up with that one statement of the gentlemen who said nothing was left to be invented after the steam engine. Focus on accelerating change, and open up with Baltazar Gracian's saying, that took more than century to educate a man than before intro, with the quote in the beginning 1650, also do quotes for each of the chapters. Like Alice, mention we have to run faster just to stay in place in the Brave New Techworld, which is a nice way to wrap up the theme of the book, that if you're feeling overwhelmed with the rapid pace of change that's okay, everyone is, as the subliminal message to the reader.

If we smoothly transition ideas from chapter to chapter, culminating in a grand finale climax of the book, then no one will suspect any of these chapters were written as disjointed articles, not that they are like this.

Keep collecting good ideas here, which we could arrange into modular units, which could then be pleasantly and interesting arranged into a flowing sequence which would make up the book

Try to get to a beefy 300+ pages so people feel that the book is worth their money.

Keep researching the most interesting ideas, and collect those ideas to then write around that in a preplanned manner in the style of How to Write Well While Writing Fast.

Go for a high density of great ideas like a Zizek book

# Organizing the Book

The VR book has something like 50+ chapters, and they are organized into 4 parts with headings, like Michael Crichton. Since we are writing something more inventive we could have a clever naming scheme to the 4 parts. For Michael Crichton this was Monday, Tuesday, we could have something else entirely creative.

# Pictures to Spice the Articles Up on the Site

* use very fitting and carefully chosen pictures to vary up the monotony of reading

# The Trick to Writing a Book

If we have writing experience and we do, we can really do this efficiently: we can preplan all of the articles with the methods of How to Write Fast While Writing Well, knowingly how they will fit into the book sequence, getting large advertising exposure for our game, and taking care of struggling with what to write about, since now we have an overarching sturcture

# Back of the Book Cover

On the back book cover mention anthropology education, being a programmer, and the name of the game on Steam, which will be a huge advertisement


# Writing Well

* use active voice, active action verbs
* rewrite a lot, working on one article at a time will help with this
* use variety in rhythm

# Make up New Theory

Try to make up as much new theory as possible, along with new concepts such as the human 2.0, anthrotech, all these sorts of things that could be referenced by others, especially anthropologist, making this a groundbreaking work of anthropology.

Could also send out press kits of this book to all the anthropological departments in the US. And also send out book to review by anthropology magazines.

# Advertising the Book

* send out book to all top editors / reviewers / any and all media outlets that have an audience reach, even book reviewers on YouTube, anyone by audience reach, including streamers

* as money comes in pay the agent / publishing house to send the book officially through them

# The Most Interesting Book They've Ever Read

* fill this book to the brim with amazing ideas, so they will be truly astounded when they read this book


# Reasearch for the Book

* Visions by Michi Kaku
* Cyberia
* The Story of the Future (Oculus)
* Exploring the Matrix
* Sync
* The Science of Impossibility
* Chaos Theory
*
